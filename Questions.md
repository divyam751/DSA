Topic : MergeSort

```

```text
You have to sort it out! Ended
Description

Given an array A of non-negative integers of size m. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and print out the original indices of the new sorted array.

Example:

A={4,5,3,7,1}

After sorting the new array becomes A={1,3,4,5,7}.

The required output should be "4 2 0 1 3"

NOTE: The indexing of the array starts with 0.

IMPORTANT: YOU CANNOT USE BUILT-IN SORT FUNCTION. YOU HAVE TO WRITE A SORTING ALGORITHM - Merge sort or Quick Sort


Input
Input Format :

The first line of input consists of the size of the array

The next line consists of the array of size m



Constraints :

1<=m<=1000

0<=A[i]<=1000


Output
Output consists of a single line of integers


Sample input 1

5
4 5 3 7 1

Next Greater Element

Description

Given an array of N elements, find the next greater element for each element in the array, print -1 if it does not exits. Refer to the sample I/O for better understanding


Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains N, the number of elements in the array. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <= 10^5

0 <= A[i] <= 10000


Output
For each test case, print N space separated integers, denoting the next greater element for each element,  on a new line.

sample input1
1
4
1 3 2 4

Sample output1
3 4 4 -1
