## Stack Data Structure

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is a collection of elements in which elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack. Common operations on a stack include push (adding an element) and pop (removing the top element).

### Common Operations on a Stack

1. `push(element)`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. `pop()`: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
3. `peek()`: Return the top element without removing it.
4. `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty.
5. `size()`: Return the number of elements in the stack.
6. `clear()`: Remove all elements from the stack.
7. `search(element)`: Find the 1-based position of an element from the top of the stack.

### Example Usage

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        stack.push(10);          // Stack: 10
        stack.push(20);          // Stack: 10, 20
        stack.push(30);          // Stack: 10, 20, 30

        int topElement = stack.pop(); // topElement = 30, Stack: 10, 20
        int peekElement = stack.peek(); // peekElement = 20, Stack: 10, 20

        boolean isEmpty = stack.isEmpty(); // false

        int stackSize = stack.size(); // stackSize = 2

        stack.clear(); // Stack: (empty)

        boolean isEmptyNow = stack.isEmpty(); // true
    }
}
```

### Use Cases

- Balancing symbols in expressions (e.g., parentheses, braces).
- Managing function calls and recursion.
- Undo and redo operations in software applications.
- Solving certain algorithmic problems efficiently (e.g., Depth-First Search in graphs).

Note: In Java, it is recommended to use the `Deque` interface (specifically, `LinkedList` with `addFirst()` and `removeFirst()` operations) as an alternative to implementing a stack since it provides more functionality while maintaining the LIFO behavior.
